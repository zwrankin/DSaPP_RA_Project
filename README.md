# DSaPP Research Assistant and Volunteer Projects
This repository was forked from the [DSaPP application repo](https://github.com/dssg/DSaPP_RA_Project), 
which uses data from the [Donors Choose Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kdd-cup-2014-predicting-excitement-at-donors-choose/data)

## Notebooks
- `2018_12_18_final_model.ipynb` - Main notebook, with exploratory data analysis, model development, and model validation
- `2018_12_18_NLP_model_dev.ipynb` - Try using NLP of project titles and essays to predict funding. Not successful as
only features in model but could be added to main model's feature engineering 
- `2018_12_02_NLP_sandbox.ipynb` - Use `nltk`'s Vader sentiment analyzer to create features for model. Low correlations
with funding (<3%) but still merits consideration for feature engineering.
